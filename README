Idea:

Very thin layer to abstract communication between different
programs/components etc.

Use for:
 - Distributed computing(clusters etc.)
 - Pipelines

4 layers
- App
- Top level api
- Code element dispatchers(threads/process/remote process)
- Low level objects(elem, net, grp etc.)

hard work to build safety into c.
 - much easier to just put the whole struct in the header!!
  - makes you think about the layout/relationships though
